# social-media-usage-data-analysis

In this project, we are going to step into the shoes of an entry-level data analyst at a social media agency, helping to create a comprehensive report that analyzes the performance of different categories of social media posts.

## Scenario

Suppose we work for a social media marketing company that specializes in promoting brands and products on a popular social media platform. Our team is responsible for analyzing the performance of different types of posts based on categories, such as health, family, food, etc. to help clients optimize their social media strategy and increase their reach and engagement.

We are asked to use Python to automatically extract tweets posted from one or more categories, and to clean, analyze and visualize the data. The team will use our analysis to making data-driven recommendations to clients to improve their social media performance. This feature will help the marketing agency deliver tweets on time, within budget, and gain fast results.

## Objectives

1. Increase client reach and engagement
2. Gain valuable insights that will help improve social media performance
3. Achieve their social media goals and provide data-driven recommendations

## Challenge

We will be taking on the role of a social media analyst responsible for collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data on a client's social media posts. We'll also be responsible for communicating the insights and making data-driven recommendations to clients to improve their social media performance. To do this, we will set up the environment, identify the categories for the post (fitness, tech, family, beauty, etc) process, analyze, and visualize data.
